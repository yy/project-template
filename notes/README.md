# Notes

Research notes, literature notes, ideas, and meeting notes. Use whatever format works for you — plain Markdown files work well and keep everything searchable and version-controlled.

## Suggested organization

- **Daily notes** — date-stamped entries for research logs.
- **Topic folders** — group notes by topic (e.g., `literature/`, `meetings/`, `ideas/`).
- **Tags** — use tags to cross-cut folders.

## Using as an Obsidian vault

This folder can be opened as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault ("Open folder as vault"). Vault settings in `.obsidian/` (e.g., `app.json`, `appearance.json`, `core-plugins.json`) are tracked so collaborators share the same configuration. Local UI state (`workspace.json`) and plugin runtime data are gitignored.
