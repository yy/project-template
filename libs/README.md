Create a package that you can install and use throughout the project. Use the
editable installation by running the following at the root. 

```
uv add --editable ./libs/PROJECT_PACKAGE_NAME
```

so that you don't need to keep reinstalling the library. Other external
libraries can be installed here as well.
